# Companies That Promote Literacy
Literacy and education in this country are a problem. If you don’t believe me, check out my previous post “Youre contributing to illiteracy.” It’s a cause worth contributing to, but we all lead busy lives and it can be hard to find the time to give. I’m a college student, so it can also be hard to find the money to donate. Never fear! I have a solution!

Below I’ve assembled a list of companies that are centered around helping others. Companies like Tom’s Shoes and Warby Parker made the business model famous, but there are so many other companies that support so many causes! The companies compiled on this list use your purchases to give back to literacy or education in some way. After all, it’s easier to donate to a cause when you can justify it through a cute new shirt or a new pair of shoes that you needed anyways! 

Next time you shop, shop for a cause! And when you get compliments on your new purchases, make sure you let people know where you got them!

## [Out Of Print](https://www.outofprintclothing.com/)

Fellow book worms, this company is for you! Out of Print sells literary themed apparel, children’s clothing, tote bags, accessories, socks, and much more! They offer collections based on over 20 different literary favorites including a few children books. Each purchase helps to fund literacy programs and book donations to communities in need. It also supports the authors, publishers and artists who made these iconic works an integral part of our lives.

Let’s be honest, you can never have too many t-shirts. My personal favorite is the “this is how we roll” shirt. It has a book cart on it. There’s nothing like a good pun for a cause!


## [Better World Books](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/)

At Better World Books you can find used or new books at the same prices you'd find nearly anywhere else, except they will match your purchase with a donation to someone in need! Their three main nonprofit partners are Books For Africa, The National Center for Families Learning, and Room to Read, but they also work with The Robinson Community Learning Center, The Prison Book Program, and Ride for Reading.

You’re going to buy the book anyways, you might as well make the purchase worth it! They even sell textbooks! Giving back might take away some of the pain from the fact that you’re buying textbooks.

## [Yoobi](https://yoobi.com/)

Yoobi (pronouced “you-be”) sells art supplies, notebooks, pens, and pretty much anything you can use in a school or office. Their supplies come in vibrant colors to help spark your creativity! For each item purchased, another is donated to a school that needs it in the US.

I think it’s time your desk got a makeover! And your friends desk. And your professors desk. They also have 3D erasers… be the envy of everyone in class… get the erasers! Added bonus: Yoobi products are sold at Target so you don’t even need to order online!


## [EverMaya](https://evermaya.com/) 

EverMaya combines leather and traditional huipil embroidered fabrics from Guatemala to create stylish bags (and also some home goods). A portion of every sale goes to a school in Guatemala for disadvantaged children where they can access education, nutrition, healthcare, counseling, and career guidance. 

Let’s be honest, when do you not need a new bag?

## [Sseko Designs](https://ssekodesigns.com/)

Sseko sells sandals, leather bags, and other accessories made by women in Uganda. In addition to employment, these women are provided with scholarship opportunities to help pursue their dreams and overcome poverty.

Sseko sells ribbon sandals, and if you don’t know what they are you’re about to realize you need a pair. These sandals have interchangeable fabric straps that can be styled in hundreds of different ways! It’s like a hundred pairs of shoes in one!! Plus you can buy additional fabric straps, so you can switch up your look all summer long!

## [ONEHOPE](https://www.onehopewine.com/)

ONEHOPE was founded to create exceptional products that inspire people to indulge while doing good. What are you indulging in, you ask? Wine. That’s right. ONEHOPE works with Room to Read to fund literacy education for children. 

Each of their wines are targeted at a different cause, so if you want to support literacy I hope you like a good Riesling. Honestly, I don’t know why you kept reading after wine. 

## [Sevenly](https://www.sevenly.org/) 

You might have already heard of Sevenly’s 7-day cause campaigns. Each week they invite customers to purchase “advocacy art, apparel and accessories” that donate to non-profits. Their ‘cause art’ comes from artists worldwide that celebrates the work of the selected non-profits. Not every weekly non-profit gives back to a literacy and education centered non-profit, but you can always shop by their cause-themed collections, one of which is education.

My favorite part about these shirts is that they represent the cause you’re supporting. Not only do you get to support your cause, you get to show people that you do too! Get the conversation going and get people involved! 



Happy Shopping!
