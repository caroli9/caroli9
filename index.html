								<h3>About this Website</h3>
								<p>Over the course of a semester for a Writing in Digital Media class, a group of four Virginia Tech students worked to advocate for public education with a focus on Teach For America. This website is a result of that work. We collaborated on our video and podcast, but the blogpost were individual works. If you'd like to take a look at what the other three group members wrote in their blogs, you can visit their sites <a href="https://jasona5.github.io/">here</a>, <a href="https://wkath96.github.io/">here</a>, and <a href="https://kfought.github.io/">here</a>. </p>
