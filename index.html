								<h3>Make the Fight your Career</h3>
								<p>Good teachers are always in need, but you don't have to become a teacher to impact education. Principals, school system leaders, elected public officials, and policy leaders can all impact education! There's even a whole new industry in the tech world centered around improving education.

								<h3>About this Website</h3>
								<p>Over the course of a semester for a Writing in Digital Media class, a group of four Virginia Tech students worked to advocate for public education with a focus on Teach For America. This website is a result of that work. We collaborated on our video and podcast, but the blog posts were individual works. If you'd like to take a look at what the other three group members wrote in their blogs, you can visit their sites <a href="https://jasona5.github.io/">here</a>, <a href="https://wkath96.github.io/">here</a>, and <a href="https://kfought.github.io/">here</a>. </p>
